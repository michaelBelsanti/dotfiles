# Warning

These dotfiles are made for my setup and lots of stuff is hardcoded, like calling certain applications and setting things to specific monitors. I also have a bad habit of using pixels instead of percentages when configuring things so some stuff will be really small on high res. Make sure to read through the any configs you use.

Neovim, Picom, and Rofi should work out of the box on any system.
